# Commonwealthity

A silly goofy project that i've had in my head for years.

## Development

The following is required to build this project:

- Rust
  - Including `cargo-make` (which should install necessary components as-and-when)
- Node, pnpm, & turbo
- Protobuf & CMake
  - (For builds including TiKV)
  - macOS: `brew install protobuf cmake`
